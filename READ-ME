Cyber threat detection application (Python)

This is a predictive model (machine learning classifier) capable of distinguising between "intrusive" traffic (threats, attacks) and "good" (normal) traffic.

The app:

- creates additional features by taking the latent representation of an autoencoder. Five different autoencoders are built and compared
- combines these additional features with the original dataset
- applies feature selection techniques. Three different techniques have been built and compared
- builds ML algorithms for classification
- evaluates the classification performance of each algo; accuracy, detection rate, false alarms, type II errors etc.
- achieves 97.84% accuracy using a denoising autoencoder, ExtraTrees and MLP
